## üìù TASK DESCRIPTION

This Java application retrieves upcoming public holidays for any country by integrating with the **Nager.Date REST API**. It demonstrates key backend programming skills by:

- Accepting country codes (e.g., `US`, `IN`) from user input  
- Performing HTTP GET requests using Java‚Äôs `HttpClient` API  
- Parsing JSON responses with the `org.json` library  
- Handling invalid inputs and API errors gracefully  
- Displaying holiday names, dates, and local descriptions  

This mini-project is a practical exercise in working with third-party APIs and JSON in Java.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SETUP: Adding `org.json` Library

1. Download `json-20210307.jar` from the Maven repository:  
   üì• [Download Here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/json/json/20210307/json-20210307.jar)

2. Place the file in your project folder, for example:  
   `C:\JAVA\Codtech_Tasks-2\`

3. Compile and run the Java file with the jar in the classpath:


**Compile**
```
javac -cp .;json-20210307.jar HolidayFetcher.java
```

**Run**
```
java -cp .;json-20210307.jar HolidayFetcher
```

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

This project offered practical exposure to real-time API integration using Java. By working with RESTful web services, parsing JSON responses, and handling user input and errors effectively, I strengthened my backend development skills. The experience provided a solid foundation for building more complex API-driven applications in the future.
